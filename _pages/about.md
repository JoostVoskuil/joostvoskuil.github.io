I am a DevOps consultant specializing in Microsoft Technology. Through my roles within Enablement and Platform teams (such as CoEs & IT4IT), I have extensive experience supporting, growing, and coaching development teams on their Continuous Delivery & DevOps journey. I balance between coach and engineer and use the 'show, do together, do yourself' principle, where I find it important that teams not only work on their Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery pipelines but also work on how the software development lifecycle can be organized more efficiently and effectively. I focus on the DORA metrics and coach on the behavior associated with Continuous Delivery, such as intensive collaboration within and outside the team, Trunk-Based Development/GitHub flow, Build Quality In, Done means released & Hold the (pipe) line. I facilitate workshops for value stream mapping, risk analysis (risk storming), and example mapping (BDD).

I easily build relationships and often get along well with both developers and stakeholders. These relationships are important for working on the behavioral change that accompanies modern application development, where I find it important to set an example. Due to my openness, developers often see me as a confidant, and I quickly receive feedback on how the IT development platform can be improved. I enjoy contributing to this improvement. I have sufficient experience with the concepts of software development and with dotnet and typescript to support development teams.

I am capable of setting up and expanding IT4IT platforms, including self-hosted agents, containers for container jobs, onboarding, user & license management, pipeline templates, and standard pipelines. Within various organizations, I have taken the lead in redesigning the DevOps IT4IT tooling to make it future-proof. I regularly delve into the latest market developments by reading articles and books and trying out the latest tools. Additionally, I have an affinity for tools that ensure quality and security scanning in the pipelines, such as SonarQube/Cloud and Software Composition Analysis (SCA)/Dependency scanning. I am also the developer of the open-source Gitleaks extension for Azure DevOps to detect secrets in git repositories.

Annually, I provide guest lectures and offer technical support at The Hague University of Applied Sciences for both part-time and full-time IT programs on topics related to DevOps practices (BDD, Coding, Pipelines, and Testing).

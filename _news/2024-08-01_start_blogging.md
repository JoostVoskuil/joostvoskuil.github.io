While I had this idea for years, I finally started my own website for blogging and sharing my ideas. It's mostly lightweight content, often work-related. Some posts will be in English, and some will be in Dutch.

Of course, as always, my opinions are my own. They are work-related but not connected to my employer or any marketing.

For this website, I am using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

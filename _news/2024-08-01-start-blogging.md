While I had this idea already for years, I finally started my own website for blogging and venting my ideas. Just some lightweight stuff about – for most of the time – work related stuff. Some will be in English, some will be in Dutch.

Of course - as always – my oppinions are my own. They are work related but they are not related to my employer nor any marketing. 

For this website I started using GitHub Pages and Jekkyl.
